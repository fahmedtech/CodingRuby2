<h2>IT 212 -- Project 3</h2>

<ul type="disc">

<li><b>Goal:</b> Implement and test Card and Deck classes as shown in the
<a href="http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sjost/it212/uml-examples/card-deck-uml.htm">Card/Deck UML Diagram</a>.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Details:</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>The ranks of the cards from lowest to highest:<br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>
2&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 4&nbsp; 5&nbsp; 6&nbsp; 7&nbsp; 8&nbsp; 9&nbsp; 10&nbsp; J&nbsp; Q&nbsp; K&nbsp; A
</ul><br></li>

<li>The order of the suits from lowest to highest:<br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>
C&nbsp; D&nbsp; H&nbsp; S &nbsp; (Club Diamond Heart Spade)
</ul><br></li>

<li>Include two test scripts test1.rb and test2.rb.<br>&nbsp;<br>
<ol type="a">
<li>test1.rb tests both the <span class="tt">Card</span> and <span class="tt">Deck</span> classes in the traditional way using print statements.&nbsp;Test all methods in the 
<span class="tt">Card</span> and <span class="tt">Deck</span> classes.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>test2.rb tests both the <span class="tt">Card</span> and <span class="tt">Deck</span> classes using the unit test framework with assert_equal methods.&nbsp;
Write unit tests for all methods in the <span class="tt">Card</span> class, but you only have to test 
these methods in the <span class="tt">Deck </span>class: <span class="tt">new, deal, 
add_to_bottom, add_to_top, count, empty?</span><br>&nbsp;<br>

When writing unit tests for add_to_bottom and add_to_top, you only need to check that the count of the Deck object increased by 1; you don't need to 
check the actual contents of the Deck object after the method call.  When writing unit tests for deal, just check that the count of the Deck object
decreased by 1 and the value of the Card object that was returned.
</li>

<a name="proj3hints">
<h3>Hints:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Double check the UML diagram to see if the parameters that you are passing in to each method is correct.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Test your <span class="tt">Card</span> class completely before starting to write the 
<span class="tt">Deck</span> class.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>The bottom of the deck is index 0; the top of the deck is the maximum index (51 in the 52 card deck).
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Here are three Array methods that you may want to use in your implementation 
of the <span class="tt">Deck</span> class:<br>&nbsp;<br>
<ol type="a">
<li>
Add a new card onto the top of the deck:<br>
<ul>
<pre>@cards.push(c)
</pre>
</ul>
Here is how to create a new card with the specified rank and suit 
and append it to the array:<br>
<ul>
<pre>c = Card.new(rank, suit)
@cards &lt;&lt; c

# or

c = Card.new(rank, suit)
@cards.push(c)

# or shorter

@cards.push(Card.new(rank, suit)
</pre>
</ul></li>

<li>Remove a card from the top of the <span class="tt">@cards</span> array:<br>
<ul>
<pre>@cards.pop
</pre>
</ul></li>

<li>Insert a card c at the bottom of the deck (before the item with index 0):<br>
<ul>
<pre>@cards.insert(0, c)
</pre>
</ul>
When a card is inserted before index 0 or in the middle of the array, the index of each card that is greater than the insertion point
is increased by 1 to make room for the insertion.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Shuffle the <span class="tt">Card</span> objects in the deck:<br>
<ul>
<pre>@cards.shuffle!
</pre>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>

<li>Use a double loop in the Deck#initialize method like this:<br>
<ul>
<pre>@cards = [ ]
for rank in 2..14
  for suit in ['C', 'D', 'H', 'S']
    # create a new card with the specified rank
    # and suit and append it to the array.   
  end
end </pre></ul>
You can use the array append operator 
&lt;&lt; or you can use Array#push.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Use a single loop to show all the cards in the Deck#to_s method:<br>
<ul>
<pre>output = ""
for card in @cards
  # Concatenate all of the cards 
  # to the output variable
end</pre></ul>
Use the <span class="tt">+=</span> operator to concatenate all the cards to the output string.
The ith card in the <span class="tt">@cards</span> array is <span class="tt">@cards[i]</span>.  You will need to get the string representation of this
card before appending it.  Don't forget to put spaces between the cards.&nbsp; 
The last line in the body of the <span class="tt">to_s</span> method must be<br>
<ul>
<pre>return output
</pre>
</ul>
Make sure that you don't print anything in the to_s methods.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>In the <span class="tt">initialize</span> method, define <span class="tt">@symbols</span> to be the array of possible symbols for rank shown on the card objects.
These symbols are used in the <span class="tt">to_s</span> method.<br>
<ul>
<pre>@symbols = [nil, nil, '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', 
   '7', '8', '9', '10', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A']
</pre>
</ul></li>

<li>ThThe <span class="tt">Card</span> class does not have setters for rank and suit because rank and suit should be read-only;
you can't change the rank and suit of a card after the card is created.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Cards in a new, unshuffled deck are placed in this order, bottom to top:<br>
<ul>
<pre>2C 3C 4C 5C 6C 7C 8C 9C 10C JC QC KC AC
2D 3D 4D 5D 6D 7D 8D 9D 10D JD QD KD AD
2H 3H 4H 5H 6H 7H 8H 9H 10H JH QH KH AH
2S 3S 4S 5S 6S 7S 8S 9S 10S JS QS KS AS
</pre>
</ul></li>

<li>Whenever you print something, always put a new line at the end unless there is a good reason
not to.  Including new lines at the end of your print statements makes your output more readable.
To double space, do this:<br>
<ul>
<pre>print d.count, "\n\n"
</pre></ul></li>

<li>The number of parameters you pass in to the constructor call (in this case Card.new)
must match the number of parameters of the initialize method for that class.  In the 
case of the Card class,<br>
<ul>
<pre>c = Card.new(rank, suit)
</pre></ul>
has two inputs because the header for initialize also has two parameters:<br>
<ul>
<pre>def initialize(the_rank, the_suit)
</pre>
</ul>
</li>

<li>In you traditional test file test1.rb, do not print the return values of methods like
Deck#add_to_top, Deck#add_to_bottom, Deck#shuffle!.  For example, for Deck#add_to_top:<br>
<ul>
<pre># Don't do this:
d = Deck.new
c = Card.new(12, 'S')
print d.add_to_top(c), "\n"

# Do this:
d = Deck.new
c = Card.new(12, 'S')
d.add_to_top(c)
print d, "\n"
</pre></ul></li>

<li>To test the initialize and to_s methods of the Deck class, do this:<br>
<ul>
<pre>d = Deck.new
print d, "\n"
</pre></ul>
(The method Deck#initialize does not have any parameters, so Deck.new should not have
any parameters either.)<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Inheritance is not used for Project 3, for the first line of the Deck class:<br>
<ul>
<pre># Incorrect:
class Deck &lt; Card

# Correct:
class Deck
</pre>
</ul>
<ul>
	<pre></pre>
</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
