<h2>IT 212 -- Project 2</h2>

<ul type="disc">

<li><b>Goal:</b> write an application that computes all of the amicable
numbers less than the upper bound that is read in using a gets statement.&nbsp; 
(Use STDIN.gets if you want to be more complete.)<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>This project is designed to give you practice using structured programming
constructs in Ruby, in particular the if..elsif..end and for constructions.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>The computations will be done in the main method output will be shown by 
printing directly to the command line with print (or STDOUT.print if you want to 
be more complete.)<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Two numbers a and b are amicable if the factors of a sum to b 
and the factors of b sum to a.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><b>Example:</b> The factors of 220 are 
1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110; 
1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 55 + 110 = 284.<br>
The factors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, 142;
1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220. 
Therefore, 220 and 284 a pair of amicable numbers.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>A simpler problem is finding all the perfect numbers as shown in the 
<a href="http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sjost/it212/examples.htm#perfect1">Perfect1</a> and  <a href="http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sjost/it212/examples.htm#perfect2">Perfect2</a> Examples.  
You can use the sum_factors method from the Perfect2 Example to compute the sum of the factors
of any integer.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>A number is <b>perfect</b> if its factors sum to itself.  
The two perfect numbers less than 100 are 6 and 28 because 
6 = 1 + 2 + 3 and 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Modify the Perfect2 Example to find all amicable numbers less than the input value. 
Check that it works when you enter 5000. Remember how to 
change the string input read by STDIN.gets into an integer.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>To check if n belongs to an amicable pair, find the sum (sum1) 
of the factors of n.
Then find the sum (sum2) of all the factors of sum1.  If n is equal to sum2, 
you have found a pair of amicable numbers.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Do not print any pair of perfect numbers in your output and do not print a pair of amicable numbers more than once.
You can satisfy these requirements by only printing the numbers n and sum1 where<br>
<ul>
<pre>n == sum2 &amp;&amp; n &lt; sum1 
</pre>
</ul></li>

<a name="hints">
<li><span class="blue">Additonal Requirement:</span><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul> 
Use the sum_factors method from the Perfect Example that computes the sum of all the factors of the value
passed to it.
</ul></li>
