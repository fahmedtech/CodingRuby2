<h2>IT 212 -- Project 5</h2>

<ul type="disc">

<li><b>Goal:</b> Write a computer simulation of children's card game of War.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> &nbsp; The <span class="tt">Card</span> and 
<span class="tt">Deck</span> classes from Project 3.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Rules of War Card Game:</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>The number of players is two.
<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>A newly created deck of cards is shuffled seven times.
<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Cards are dealt from this deck to each player from a standard 52 card deck to form
two 26 card player stacks, called the downstacks. Each stack is face down on the table in front of each 
player.
<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Each player draws the top card from his or her down stack.
(Use the deal method of <span class="tt">DownStack</span> to obtain the card.)  The
card with the higher rank wins. Both cards are added to the bottom
of the winning player's down stack along with any cards in the limbo stack, as described 
in Rule 5. Use the add_to_bottom and deal methods to move cards from the limbo 
stack to the player's down stack like this:<br>
<ul>
<pre>until @limbo_stack.is_empty?
  @player_a.add_to_bottom @limbo_stack.deal
end
</pre>
</ul></li>

<li>In case there is a tie for the rank, each player places the 
card with tied rank, along with three additional cards into the
"in limbo" stack, called the limbo stack.  Then they play again (Rules 4 and 5). <br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>A player loses the game if he or she runs out of cards (the player's 
down_stack becomes empty) or 5,000 plays have occurred. If the 5,000 play limit 
is reached, the game is a draw.&nbsp; A player can run out of cards either during an 
ordinary play (Rule 4) or 
when supplying cards to the limbo_stack (Step 5).</li></ol><br></li>

<li><strong>UML Diagram:</strong> &nbsp; Here is the <a href="http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sjost/it212/uml-examples/downstack-wargame.htm">DownStack/WarGame UML Diagram</a>.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>New Classes</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>DownStack</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul class="nobullet">
<li>The DownStack class inherits from the Deck class.  The only difference is that intially, a 
DownStack object is empty
and is populated by dealing cards to it from the original deck. Override 
the DownStack#initialize method to accomplish this. This is the only code that
you need to define the DownStack class:<br>
<ul>
<pre>class DownStack &lt; Deck
  def initialize
    @cards = [ ]
  end
end
</pre>
</ul>
Note that DownStack inherits Deck and the initialize method overrides Deck#initialize.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>You may want to use this version of to_s in the Deck class to make the output easier to read:<br>
<ul>
<pre>def to_s
  output = ""
  count = 1
  for card in @cards
    output += card.to_s + " ";
    if count % 13 == 0
      output += "\n"
    end
    count += 1
  end
  return output;
end
</pre>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>WarGame</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul class="nobullet">
<li>WarGame method descriptions:<br>&nbsp;<br>
<ol type="a">
<li><strong>initialize</strong> &nbsp; Create the object <span class="tt">orig_deck</span> as a new
<span class="tt">Deck</span> object. 
(<span class="tt">orig_deck </span>is only used in the initialize method, so it can be a local 
variable). Create the objects <span class="tt">@player_a</span>, 
<span class="tt">@player_b,</span> and <span class="tt">@limbo_stack</span> as new 
<span class="tt">DownStack</span> objects. Set <span class="tt">@num_plays</span> to 0.
Shuffle orig_deck seven times, and deal 26 cards to each player (<span class="tt">@player_a</span> and 
<span class="tt">@player_b</span>). Here is a start on the code for this method:<br>
<ul>
<pre>def initialize
    
  orig_deck = Deck.new
  @player_a = DownStack.new
  @player_b = DownStack.new
  @limbo_stack = DownStack.new
  
  # Shuffle deck
  (1..7).each
    orig_deck.shuffle!
  end

  # Deal out cards to player
  # a and player b:
  (1..26).each
     @player_a orig_deck.deal
     # Same for player b.  
  end
end
</pre>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>num_plays</strong> &nbsp; The number of plays in the game so far. 
Getter for <span class="tt">@num_plays</span>.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>total_cards_ok</strong> &nbsp; Return true if the total cards in the downstacks is 52, false otherwise.&nbsp; 
You can use this method definition:<br>
<ul>
<pre>def total_cards_ok
  return (@player_a.count + @player_b.count +
    @limbo_stack.count) == 52
end
</pre></ul></li>
<li><strong>winner</strong> &nbsp; Return the winner <span class="tt">"a"</span> or 
<span class="tt">"b"</span> if the game is over. 
(If <span class="tt">@player_b.count == 0</span> return <span class="tt">"a"</span>; else if 
<span class="tt">@player_a.count == 0</span> return <span class="tt">"b"</span>.)&nbsp; 
If there is not yet a winner, return <span class="tt">nil</span>.
<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>play</strong> &nbsp; Complete a single play as described in Rule 4 of the Rules of War Card Game.
Add one to <span class="tt">@num_plays</span>.<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>finish_game</strong> &nbsp; Repeatedly call the play method until there 
is a winner or until 5,000 plays have occurred, in which case there is a draw.
<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>to_s</strong> &nbsp; Print the number of plays so far, the count of the player_a downstack,
the cards in the <span class="tt">@player_a</span> downstack, obtained from the its 
<span class="tt">to_s</span> method, the count of the 
<span class="tt">@player_b</span> downstack,
the cards in the player_b downstack, obtained from the its to_s method, the count of the 
<span class="tt">@limbo_stack</span>,
the cards in the limbo stack downstack, obtained from the its <span class="tt">to_s</span> method.  Here is a sample return string from
<span class="tt">WarGame#to_s</span>:<br>
<ul>
<pre>Number of plays: 5

</ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ol></li>

<li><strong>Testing</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>Write traditional tests for each of the methods in the DownStack and WarGame classes.
No unit test files are required. (The results of game play are random, so unit testing is difficult for these 
classes.)<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>Start off with the WarGame class by writing the initialize and to_s methods.  Test them with this small script:<br>
<ul>
<pre>require './WarGame'
war = WarGame.new
print war, "\n"
</pre>
</ul></li>

<li>When you are finished with the WarGame class, include this standalone script to test your game in general.&nbsp; Put it 
in a file named test-script.rb so the grader can run this script.<br>
<pre>require './WarGame.rb'

war = WarGame.new
print war, "\n"
10.times do
  print war, "\n"
  war.play  
end

print "Winner NumPlays\n"
print "====== ========\n"
5.times do
  war = WarGame.new
  war.finish_game
  print " %3s %4d\n" %
    [war.winner, war.num_plays] 
end
</pre></li>
</ol></li>

<li><strong>Grading</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>
Functionality: 65% &nbsp;  Proper Indentation: 10% &nbsp; Source Code Comments: 10% &nbsp; Test Script Included 10% &nbsp; Properly Submitted 5%<br>&nbsp;<br>
To properly submit your project:<br>
<ol type="1">
<li>Put each class in its own file. For example, the WarGame class goes in 
the WarGame.rb file.</li>
<li>Put all files to submit in a single folder named proj5smith (replace 
Smith by your last name).</li>
<li>Zip the file in 2 to produce the zipfile proj5smith.zip, so that your 
last name in the zip file name.</li>
<li>Include a header with the project number, your name, and the submission date at the top of each source code file.</li>
</ol>
</ul></li>
</ul>
